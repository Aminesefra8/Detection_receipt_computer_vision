# Detection_receipt_computer_vision

The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of automatically detecting the total amount including tax (TTC) from images of receipts.

This solution leverages image processing and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from documents that are often complex and varied in their formatting. The system aims to simplify the processes of collecting and organizing financial data by providing a fast, accurate, and automated method for extracting key details.

This project has various applications, including expense management, accounting automation, and commercial data analysis.
